Flow Free solver

"Teller.java" is where the grid is made,
"Gridspot.java" is an extension of the rectangle class from the wheels library used, 
"Solve" sets waypoints on the rectangles and stores them in "Gridspot"
  There is also alot of scratch work in this class hehe.
"PathFinder" has a purpose of getting all possible paths in an array of Arraylists,
  where an arraylist is a path. It also has some scratch work in it, though not as 
  bad.
